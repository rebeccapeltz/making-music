The Web Dev Man \(To Billy Joelâ€™s The Piano Man\)

\(Play the start of Piano Man recording on my phone\)

It's six o'clock on a Tuesday

The regular crowd shuffles in

There's a young man sitting next to me

Organizing his obj and bin

He says, "Son, can you write me a script

I'm not really sure how it goes

But it's rad and it's neat and as short as a Tweet

And shared from your GitHub repo"

La la la, di da da

La la, di da da da dum

Write us some code, you're the web dev man

Just a few lines tonight

Well, we're all in the mood for a GUI

And you've got us feelin' alright

Now Shawn at Hunthausen is a friend of mine

He gets me my drinks at Optimism for free

And he's quick with React or a function in bash

And there's no place that he'd rather be

Oh, la la la, di da da

La la, di da da da dum

Write us some code, you're the web dev man

Just a few lines tonight

Well, we're all in the mood for a GUI

And you've got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Wednesday

And the students give me a smile

'Cause they know that it's he they've been comin' to see

To learn about coding for a while

And the keyboards, they sound like a carnival

And the mice clicking away

And they sit in the chairs with excited glares

And say, "Man, thanks for all the knowledge shares!"

Oh, la la la, di da da

La la, di da da da dum

Write us some code, you're the web dev man

Just a few lines tonight

Well, we're all in the mood for a GUI

And you've got us feelin' alright
